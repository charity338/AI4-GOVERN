# AI4-GOVERN
AI4Govern is a hackathon project developed for the NIRU AI Hackathon, focused on building an intelligent dashboard that flags potential governance and financial risks in public projects. The MVP leverages historical public contract award data from Kenya to identify high-risk contracts based on value concentration and supplier patterns.
